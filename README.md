# Java-with-Spring-Boot-by-Coursera-
I've completed certifications in Java with Spring and Spring Boot on Coursera with success, where I gained experience to create contemporary, efficient, and scalable web applications. Through project-based learning, I implemented RESTful APIs using Spring MVC and Spring Boot, and gained a clear understanding of how to design real-world Java applications.

I heavily utilized dependency injection, AOP, and Spring Data JPA to handle data and application logic in a clean and efficient manner. I also gained knowledge on how to secure applications with Spring Security and enhanced debugging and monitoring using Spring Boot Actuator.

Along with the course, I developed microservices, performed database operations, and looked at how to deploy applications into the cloud. I also got used to using Postman, Maven, and Gradle for testing and development.

These certifications reinforced my skill to develop stable, enterprise-level backend systems and helped me to feel confident in addressing real-world software development problems using Java and Spring Boot.
